		// Problem 1: Create appropriate variables to solve the problem
		// You are creating a program to calculate total shipping weight for your packages.
		// Your packages can contain any of the following items:
		//	- Coffee beans (5 lbs)
		//  - Coffee filters (3.5 lbs)
		//  - Purified water (25 lbs)
		// How much will a package weight if it contains 4 orders of coffee beans,
		// 6 orders of coffee filters, and 2 containers of purified water?
		// Display your results to the screen

		double coffeeFilterWeight = 3.5;
		double waterWeight = 25.0;
		
		double coffeeBeanPackage = coffeeBeanWeight * 4;
		double coffeeFilterPackage = coffeeFilterWeight * 6;
		double waterPackage = waterWeight * 2;
		
		double totalWeight = coffeeBeanPackage + coffeeFilterPackage + waterPackage;
		
		System.out.println("Coffee Bean Packaged Weight: " + coffeeBeanPackage + "(lbs)");
		System.out.println("Coffee Filter Packaged Weight: " + coffeeFilterPackage + "(lbs)");
		System.out.println("Purified Water Packaged Weight: " + waterPackage + "(lbs)");
		System.out.println("Total Packaged Weight: " + totalWeight + "(lbs)");
		
		
		//Problem 2 : If shipping costs $3.75 per lbs, how much will your shipment cost?
		// Display your results to the screen

		double costPerLbs = 3.75;
		double shippingCost = totalWeight * costPerLbs;
		System.out.println("Shipping cost = $" + shippingCost);
		
		
		//Problem 3 : If half of your shipment is lost, what is the new shipping weight 
		//			  and new cost for shipping?  Display your results to the screen
		
		double halfShippingWeight = totalWeight / 2;
		double halfShippingCost = shippingCost / 2;
