		//The only change made from the previous for loop is in the incrementer.

		*Counting Exercises

		***********************************/
		
		//Problem 1
		//Create a for loop that counts from 1 to 10
		
		
		
		//Problem 2
		//Create a for loop that counts from 3 to 15

		
		
		//Problem 3
		//Create a for loop that counts from 0 to 50 by counting by 5

		
		
		//Problem 4
		//Create a for loop that counts from 10 to 1

		
		
		//Problem 5
		//Create a for loop that counts from 50 to 0 by counting down by 5

		
		
		//Problem 6
		//Create a for loop that count by multiples of 3, up to 90
		
		
		
		/**********************************
		*
		*Repetitive Exercises
		*
		***********************************/
		
		//Problem 1
		//Sum all the numbers from 1 to 50
		
		
		
		//Problem 2
		//Display all odd numbers from 0 to 16
		
		
		
		//Problem 3
		//Take 10 numbers, find their sum
		
		
		
		//Problem 4
		//Take 10 numbers from the user, display a message if
		// x < 100 : "That's a tiny number"
		// 100 < x < 200 : "That number is a bit high.."
		//x > 200 : "That number is crazy!"
		
		
		
		//Problem 5
		//Take 10 number pairs and provide a menu for the user 
		//     1. Find the sum
		//	   2. Find the difference
		//     3. Find the product
		//     4. Find the quotient
		//Process the user's choice with if/else statements
		
		
		//Problem 6: Rewrite Problem 5 using a switch statement to process the user's 
		//			 response.
